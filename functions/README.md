# Functions

This is writing basic functions to work with numbers, vectors, integers, etc.

```bash
$ cargo build
```

And then to run:

```bash
$ ./target/debug/functions
The sum is 20
Starting vector is [1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 1]
Deduped vector is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Before filtering [1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 1]
After filtering [2, 4, 4]
Matrix 1 [[1.0, 1.0, 1.0], [1.0, 1.0, 1.0], [1.0, 1.0, 1.0]]
Matrix 2 [[5.0, 5.0, 5.0], [5.0, 5.0, 5.0], [5.0, 5.0, 5.0]]
Empty Matrix to fill [[0.0, 0.0, 0.0], [0.0, 0.0, 0.0], [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]]
Finished matrix: [[15.0, 15.0, 15.0], [15.0, 15.0, 15.0], [15.0, 15.0, 15.0]]
```
