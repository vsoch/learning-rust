# Learning Rust!

I found an old repository with [homeworks](https://github.com/cis198-2016s)
and it looks like a great way to learn! I'll also add some random Advent of
Code Problems here.

To creat a new project:

```bash
$ cargo new --bin <project>
```

Then to run/build it:

```bash
$ cd <project>
$ cargo run
$ cargo build
```

That's pretty much where I am :)
