# Binary Search Tree

This is an attempt at a binary search tree in Rust. I'm also using the clippy
feature for code formatting, which needs to enable / add the nightly channel:

```bash
$ rustup toolchain install nightly
```

Then:

```bash
cargo build --features clippy
cargo test --features clippy
```
